ðŸ‘‰This project simulates real-world banking operations with a simple, menu-driven interface:

âœ… Deposit

âœ… Withdraw

âœ… Check Balance

âœ… Transaction History 

âœ…  Exit

ðŸ”¹ Tech Used: Python (functions, loops, conditional statements, user input, datetime module).
ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes: Strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals, modular programming, and problem-solving through practical application.

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to improving this by adding features like authentication, receipts, and database integration
